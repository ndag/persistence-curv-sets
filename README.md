The software was developed by Mario Gomez and Facundo Memoli. We also use functions written by Misha Belkin (L2_distance.m), Vin de Silva (px_fps.m), and Uli Bauer (Ripser: https://github.com/Ripser/ripser).

## Installation Instructions:
1. From a terminal go to the Ripser folder and type 'make ripser-coeff'
2. Check your Matlab distribution. You should install the Parallel Computing Toolbox https://www.mathworks.com/products/parallel-computing.html
3. Edit the file Persistence_Parsave.m. Pay attention to the different flags and variables such as *n* and *d* and *ncores*.
